## Description
The Factorisation Benchmark tool is a multi-threaded benchmarking tool
written in C for 2803 Operating Systems Programming. It was developed
as the second assignment for this subject, which was taken in my second
year of Griffith University, as part of their Computer Science Program
in 2017.
